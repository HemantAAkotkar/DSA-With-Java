📘 DSA With Java

A collection of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems solved using Java.
This repository is created to track my DSA learning journey, improve coding skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

🚀 About This Repository

This repo contains:

Clean and well-structured Java solutions

Multiple approaches wherever possible

Optimal time and space complexity

Problems from topics like arrays, strings, recursion, sorting, trees, graphs, DP, etc.

Regular updates as I learn and solve new problems
